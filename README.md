# RollForQuirk
Roll for Quirk is a generator for Dungeons and Dragons that focuses entirely on the roleplay aspect of the game. 
Instead of offering the same character-building experience that countless other generators do, Roll for Quirk generates a series of traits to assist the player in fleshing out their character's personality.
# Description
The internet is full of character generators for Dungeons and Dragons, as well as sites that provide all the support needed to manage the complexity of a character's stats, gear, and spells. There are even a few generators for quirks to help roleplay your character, but none of them have that chaotic twist. Instead of the ever-tired trope of vengeance, with Roll for Quirk your character may be driven by a pathological need to make breakfast.
